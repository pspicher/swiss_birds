    "The images are our principal data, which makes them very important to analyze. However, we can't use the same tools we would use for numerical or text data. Here even more than elsewhere, visualisation is considerably more powerful than other approachs. Typically, the images may differ by the type of take : some birds are taken flying, while other are taken at rest on the floor. Unfortunately, the metadata doesn't contain any information about the type of take. Since the number of images available is relatively small, I decided to display all pictures as thumbnails in order to assess their characteristics and quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Printing thumbnails of images on serveral rows and columns is a good mean to have a quick visual assessment of the pictures. On the other hand, printing all images in notebook is not very efficient since it will overload the RAM. The first section of the present notebook is used to create figures with matplotlib and save them as pdf files. Those files will then be used for visual assessment.\n",
